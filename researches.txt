circut :
Doing string operations in your circuit definition is structurally wrong, IMO. Circuits should verify a relationship that you already know, using inputs pre-processed in order to be efficiently verifiable.
E.g. you would compute outside of the circuit that the string does indeed end with a substring, and then pass the position of that substring to the circuit in order for it to verify that fact.
